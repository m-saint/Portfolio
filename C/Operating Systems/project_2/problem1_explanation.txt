My solution avoids depriving one shoe type of the stage by setting up a yielding pattern, triggered by a shoe leaving behind an empty stage. A shoe that leaves an empty stage signals another waiting type that they may now control the stage. Any shoe type that dominates the stage must endure longer sleep times before re-entry. This guarantees there will soon be a shoe that leaves without any others of its type being ready to enter.
