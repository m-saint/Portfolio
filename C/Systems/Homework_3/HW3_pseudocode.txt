get_totals: 
- open up the file we wanna write to
- for every item we sell, count up the sales across all months, then print it to the file and repeat

get_profits:
- open up our file
- print out the colum labels all nice n pretty
- same as get_totals, count up how many we sold of each item
- but also for each item, use that number sold along with the price and cost of that item to calculate total sales cost and revenue for that item
- print alll that to the file and repeat

 top_earner:
- make an array to store code, quantity, and total revenue for each item
- just like before, count up our sales and do the math
- but then we gotta store those numbers in an array instead of printing right away
- so we then loop through our array, and sort it by revenue, highest to lowest
  - one by one, the higher revenues will rise (with their corresponding code and quantity) to the top and the lower ones will sink down till we're all nice and ordered
- now we get to print the first 10 earners to the file
